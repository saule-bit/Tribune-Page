            <h2 class="heading">Here's Abai Qunanbaiuly's life:</h2><br>
            <h3 class="heading-content">Early life and education</h3>
            <p class="text">Abai was born in Karauyl village in Chingiz volost of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semey" target="_blank">Semipalatinsk</a> uyezd of the Russian Empire (this is now in Abay District of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Kazakhstan_Region" target="_blank">East Kazakhstan</a>). He was the son of Qunanbai and Uljan, his father's second wife. They named him Ibrahim, as the family was Muslim, and he stuck with the name for the first few years of his life. His father was wealthy enough to send Abai to a Russian secondary school in Semipalatinsk.</p><br>
            <h3 class="heading-content">Contributions</h3>
            <p class="text">Abai's main contribution to Kazakh culture and folklore lies in his poetry, which expresses great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism" target="_blank">nationalism</a> and grew out of Kazakh folk culture. Before him, most Kazakh poetry was oral, echoing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomad" target="_blank">nomadic</a> habits of the people of the Kazakh <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steppe" target="_blank">steppes</a>. During Abai's lifetime, however, a number of important socio-political and socio-economic changes occurred. Russian influence continued to grow in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan" target="_blank"> Kazakhstan</a> resulting in greater educational possibilities as well as exposure to a number of different philosophies, whether Russian, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_countries" target="_blank"> Western</a> or Asian. Abai Qunanbaiuly steeped himself in the cultural and philosophical history of these newly opened geographies. In this sense, Abai's creative poetry affected the philosophical theological thinking of educated Kazakhs.</p>
